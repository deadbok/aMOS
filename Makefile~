#The /bin makefiles are not complete. The user should be able to "make clean" from this directory, to
#clean every thing up, just like "make clean" in the root directory does. This requeres, that a variable
#called LEVEL should store the level in the directory tree at wich the makefile was started. Then the rest
#would be a matter of checking whether we were called from root level or start in /bin.

#26072001 22:00: added targets to make doxygen documentation, and rearanged a bit in the process ;-)
