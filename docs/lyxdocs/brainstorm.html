1 aMOS</A>
</H1>

<P>
The goal of aMOS is to be as versatile as possible, meaning that it
should adjust itself to the users needs. This goal has a lot of disadvantages
compared to a more task-oriented approach. One of them, that there
is a lot of end-user decisions when installing the OS. There are some
examples of very complex OSes on the marked, that hide a lot of details
from the user behind a pretty GUI. The simple idea behind aMOS is
that the user knows best, therefore nothing will be hidden unless
the user specifies it. 

<P>
This means that aMOS will have to ''grade'' the user when installing
itself, and ultimately learn what level the user is on, by watching
the user in action. The goal of monitoring the user, and adapting
to his needs, is as I see it a very complex task involving some kind
of intelligence in aMOS. This intelligence could then extend to handling
and recovering from crashes, and best of all see to it that they never
happen again.

<P>
Another feature that helps recovering from a crash, that every object
in aMOS is required to save the last functioning state, and figure
out what went wrong between then and the crash, and then gracefully
recover.

<P>
Both of these features may require a lot of processing power, for
monitoring, and a lot of space for saving the safe states of the objects
of aMOS.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">
1.1 The general design</A>
</H2>

<P>
The idea is to make aMOS as object oriented as possible, even though
in this early stage everything is coded in ANSI C. The reason for
choosing ANSI C is that the C library is easier to implement, and
at this stage where no binary object format has been defined, and
no compilers ported, there are some difficulties with RTTItypeset@protect

2.1 The design</A>
</H2>

<P>
The BOSS kernel is a system dependent micro kernel, that export a
default functionality no matter the features of the underlying hardware.
It is the lowest level of abstraction from the hardware of the target
system, and the base of aMOS. The level of functionality that the
BOSS kernel provides, is enough for running a usable shell thereby
creating a very simple OS, but the intended use of the BOSS kernel,
is as the base component in an operating system, that extend the services
provided by the BOSS kernel.

<P>
The goal of the BOSS kernel is to export the features found on the
target machine, without breaking the limits of the BOSS specifications,
thereby creating the base for an architecture independent OS. This
is accomplished by allowing the basic framework of the BOSS kernel
to be extended by adding modules to the fundamental classes of services.
These modules are registered as subcomponents of the service class.
For instance on the Intel x86 platform the memory manager will have
a subcomponent for managing virtual memory, since the processor support
these extensions.

<P>
The BOSS kernel export all of its services through an IPCtypeset@protect

 system that uses mailboxes. By using the IPC system as the only means
of requesting services from the BOSS kernel protection of the internals
of BOSS are greatly simplified, due to the fact that the BOSS components
has complete control when it comes to granting to access its services.

Hardware Abstraction Layer
 in Windows NT, except for the fact that HAL told Dave, that his mind
was going. Abstracting the hardware from the rest of the OS is a very
good design decision, the problem with HAL, from my point of view,
was that the drastic limitations on hardware access slowed certain
task. I am thinking about the multimedia related features of the OS,
but the point of Windows NT, I think, has never been to provide blazing
speed for multimedia applications. The goal of Windows NT was to create
a stable fault tolerant OS suitable for companies in need of a good
OS with a nice user interface.

2.1.1 Hardware interface</A>
</H3>

<P>
The BOSS has direct access to all parts of the hardware on the target
machine, but may only utilize this hardware for the sake of providing
the default functionality. The BOSS kernel provide the module mechanism
to extend the basic functionality, and take advantage of special hardware
capabilities<B>. The BOSS kernel should be designed to run on
the target architecture with no modules loaded, so that the basic
services may be provided, in case of system failure.</B> The BOSS may
implement features that are beyond standard functionality if needed.
For instance the Intel x86 version will have a virtual memory system
as default because it makes loading of modules easier. These extended
capabilities will still have the look of an extension module to the
layers running on top of the BOSS kernel.

<P>
If there are no modules loaded, the BOSS kernel will use its own standard
implementation to gain access to the hardware features of the system.
Modules provide optimizations for the rest of the system, modules
are loaded to provide better utilization of the features of for instance
the CPU, of the system.

2.1.2 BOSS interface</A>
</H3>

<P>
The BOSS kernel uses an Interprocess Communication (IPC) system to
export a default functionality. Every service provided by the BOSS
kernel has a mailbox, through which communication takes place. Basically
this is what BOSS exports:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A <I>send</I> function for sending a message to a specific mailbox
</LI>
<LI>A <I>get_mb_desc</I> to acquire a handle for a mailbox
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
2.2 The BOSS kernel functionality</A>
</H2>

<P>
The BOSS kernel has a well defined default functionality. <B>It
is required that the target system is able to provide a hardware base,
that makes it possible for the BOSS kernel to export this default
functionality</B>, either trough direct use of the hardware,
or through emulation of the missing components on top of the hardware
present. The default functionality consist of the following components:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A console
</LI>
<LI>Memory management
</LI>
<LI>Scheduling and multitasking

<LI>Protection
</LI>
<LI>IPC
</LI>
<LI>Interrupt control
</LI>
<LI>Character device control
</LI>
<LI>Block device control
</LI>
</UL>
Services from the BOSS kernel are called upon, by sending a query
message to the mailbox of the service. This makes the IPC the heart
of the BOSS kernel, and isolates the location of the BOSS kernel from
the caller, enforcing some level of protection from malicious software.
All of the exported services can have extension, provided by special
mailboxes. The exact capabilities of these extensions can be investigated
using the root service's mailbox.

2.2.1 The console</A>
</H3>

<P>
The console should be thought of as a special kind of the character
devices mentioned later. It is the device that has been used to display
status messages since the BOSS kernel was initialized. This device
is guaranteed to stay put until the BOSS has shutdown its services.
On a PC system this is usually some kind of video adapter, but this
can be any kind of device, that is able to print characters; It could
be a text file on disk. <B>The BOSS kernel implementation can
choose to provide only a dummy driver for the console</B>, so
that the messages to this output are send into oblivion.

2.2.2 Memory management</A>

The BOSS kernel export the following functions for memory management:

<UL>
<LI>Get total system memory

<LI>Get map of allocated areas and their use

<LI>Deallocate a block of memory

<LI>Rules for handling allocation of special memory blocks like DMA and
such
</LI>
</UL>
The memory management facilities of the BOSS kernel is for basic allocation
only. It is designed to allocate large blocks of memory. and is not
very fast, so lots of allocation/deallocation cycles is simply a waste
of time. The idea is to extend this memory manager by allocating a
block of memory, and letting a more specific memory allocator manage
that specific block. This means thatSpecial blocks like DMA-buffer
and the like, are handled by this allocator.

Any piece of code is split in to sections, when compiled and linked
into an object file. These sections can be both code, data, uninitialized
data, and other kinds of data that the linker needs. The module manager
must load these sections into system memory and then execute the initialization
routine from the module. The binary layout of modules are described

<P>
The section table has one entry per section in the file. A section
is a block containing raw binary data from the object file. There
may be sections in the module, that are both software and hardware
specific. The section can be identified using the section header located
at position 0 in the section, more on the format of section headers
in <A HREF="brainstorm.html#Section_header">3.3.3</A>. The position of the section is found in
the section table.
