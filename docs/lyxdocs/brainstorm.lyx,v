\layout Chapter

aMOS
\layout Standard

The goal of aMOS is to be as versatile as possible, meaning that it should
 adjust itself to the users needs.
 This goal has a lot of disadvantages compared to a more task-oriented approach.
 One of them, that there is a lot of end-user decisions when installing
 the OS.
 There are some examples of very complex OSes on the marked, that hide a
 lot of details from the user behind a pretty GUI.
 The simple idea behind aMOS is that the user knows best, therefore nothing
 will be hidden unless the user specifies it.
 
\layout Standard

This means that aMOS will have to 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset 

grade
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset 

 the user when installing itself, and ultimately learn what level the user
 is on, by watching the user in action.
 The goal of monitoring the user, and adapting to his needs, is as I see
 it a very complex task involving some kind of intelligence in aMOS.
 This intelligence could then extend to handling and recovering from crashes,
 and best of all see to it that they never happen again.
\layout Standard

Another feature that helps recovering from a crash, that every object in
 aMOS is required to save the last functioning state, and figure out what
 went wrong between then and the crash, and then gracefully recover.
\layout Standard

Both of these features may require a lot of processing power, for monitoring,
 and a lot of space for saving the safe states of the objects of aMOS.
\layout Section

The general design
\layout Standard

The idea is to make aMOS as object oriented as possible, even though in
 this early stage everything is coded in ANSI C.
 The reason for choosing ANSI C is that the C library is easier to implement,
 and at this stage where no binary object format has been defined, and no
 compilers ported, there are some difficulties with RTTI
\begin_float footnote 
\layout Standard

Run-Time Type Information
\end_float 
.
 
\series bold 
Just keep in mind that the code is destined to a complete rewrite in C++,
 and therefore keep things as object oriented as possible.
\layout Standard

There are some properties that every object in the system need to implement
 to be accepted as a liable system component:
\layout Itemize

At least one mailbox
\layout Itemize

The ability to tell other objects about its capabilities through this mailbox
\layout Itemize

Rules regarding what system compenents it may access
\layout Itemize

\emph on 
 kernel
\layout Section

The design
\layout Standard

The BOSS kernel is a system dependent micro kernel, that export a default
 functionality no matter the features of the underlying hardware.
 It is the lowest level of abstraction from the hardware of the target system,
 and the base of aMOS.
 The level of functionality that the BOSS kernel provides, is enough for
 running a usable shell thereby creating a very simple OS, but the intended
 use of the BOSS kernel, is as the base component in an operating system,
 that extend the services provided by the BOSS kernel.
\layout Standard

The goal of the BOSS kernel is to export the features found on the target
 machine, without breaking the limits of the BOSS specifications, thereby
 creating the base for an architecture independent OS.
 This is accomplished by allowing the basic framework of the BOSS kernel
 to be extended by adding modules to the fundamental classes of services.
 These modules are registered as subcomponents of the service class.
 For instance on the Intel x86 platform the memory manager will have a subcompon
ent for managing virtual memory, since the processor support these extensions.
\layout Standard

The BOSS kernel export all of its services through an IPC
\begin_float footnote 
\layout Standard

Inter-Process Communication
\end_float 
 system that uses mailboxes.
 By using the IPC system as the only means of requesting services from the
 BOSS kernel protection of the internals of BOSS are greatly simplified,
 due to the fact that the BOSS compenents has complete control when it comes
 to granting to access its services.

The BOSS kernel design
\end_float 
\layout Standard

Looking at figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:BOSSdes}

\end_inset 

 you will see that the idea behind the BOSS kernel is the same as the HAL
\begin_float footnote 
\layout Standard

Hardware Abstraction Layer
\end_float 
 in Windows NT, except for the fact that HAL told Dave, that his mind was
 going.
 Abstracting the hardware from the rest of the OS is a very good design
 decision, the problem with HAL, from my point of view, was that the drastic
 limitations on hardware access slowed certain task.
 I am thinking about the multimedia related features of the OS, but the
 point of Windows NT, I think, has never been to provide blazing speed for
 multimedia applications.
 The goal of Windows NT was to create a stable fault tolerant OS suitable
 for companies in need of a good OS with a nice user interface.
\layout Standard

Relying on an IPC system 
\layout Subsection

Hardware interface
\layout Standard

The BOSS has direct access to all parts of the hardware on the target machine,
 but may only utilize this hardware for the sake of providing the default
 functionality.
 The BOSS kernel provide the module mechanism to extend the basic functionality,
 and take advantage of special hardware capabilities
\series bold 
.
 The BOSS kernel should be designed to run on the target architecture with
 no modules loaded, so that the basic services may be provided, in case
 of system failure.

\series default 
 The BOSS may implement features that are beyond standard functionality
 if needed.
 For instance the Intel x86 version will have a virtual memory system as
 default because it makes loading of modules easier.
 These extended capabilities will still have the look of an extension module
 to the layers running on top of the BOSS kernel.
\layout Standard

If there are no modules loaded, the BOSS kernel will use its own standard
 implementation to gain access to the hardware features of the system.
 Modules provide optimizations for the rest of the system, modules are loaded
 to provide better utilization of the features of for instance the CPU,
 of the system.

The BOSS kernel hardware interface
\end_float 
\layout Subsection

BOSS interface
\layout Standard

The BOSS kernel uses an Interprocess Communication (IPC) system to export
 a default functionality.
 Every service provided by the BOSS kernel has a mailbox, through which
 communication takes place.
 Basically this is what BOSS exports:
\layout Itemize

A 
\emph on 
send
\emph default 
 function for sending a message to a specific mailbox
\layout Itemize

A 
\emph on 
get_mb_desc
\emph default 
 to acquire a handle for a mailbox
\layout Section

The BOSS kernel functionality
\layout Standard

The BOSS kernel has a well defined default functionality.
 
\series bold 
It is required that the target system is able to provide a hardware base,
 that makes it possible for the BOSS kernel to export this default functionality
\series default 
,
\series bold 
 
\series default 
either trough direct use of the hardware, or through emulation of the missing
 components on top of the hardware present.
 The default functionality consist of the following components:
\layout Itemize

A console
\layout Itemize

Memory management
\layout Itemize

Scheduling and multitasking
\layout Itemize

Protection
\layout Itemize

IPC
\layout Itemize

Interrupt control
\layout Itemize

Character device control
\layout Itemize

Block device control
\layout Standard

Services from the BOSS kernel are called upon, by sending a query message
 to the mailbox of the service.
 This makes the IPC the heart of the BOSS kernel, and isolates the location
 of the BOSS kernel from the caller, enforcing some level of protection
 from malicious software.
 All of the exported services can have extension, provided by special mailboxes.
 The exact capabilities of these extensions can be investigated using the
 root service's mailbox.

\layout Subsection

The console
\layout Standard

The console should be thought of as a special kind of the character devices
 mentioned later.
 It is the device that has been used to display status messages since the
 BOSS kernel was initialized.
 This device is guaranteed to stay put until the BOSS has shutdown its services.
 On a PC system this is usually some kind of video adapter, but this can
 be any kind of device, that is able to print characters; It could be a
 text file on disk.
 
\series bold 
The BOSS kernel implementation can choose to provide only a dummy driver
 for the console
\series default 
,
\series bold 
 
\series default 
so that the messages to this output are send into oblivion.
\layout Subsubsection

Memory management
\layout Standard

The BOSS kernel export the following functions for memory management:
\layout Itemize

Get total system memory
\layout Itemize

Get map of allocated areas and their use
\layout Itemize

Allocate a block of memory
\layout Itemize

Deallocate a block of memory
\layout Itemize

Rules for handling allocation of special memory blocks like DMA and such
\layout Standard

The memory management facilities of the BOSS kernel is for basic allocation
 only.
 It is designed to allocate large blocks of memory.
 and is not very fast, so lots of allocation/deallocation cycles is simply
 a waste of time.
 The idea is to extend this memory manager by allocating a block of memory,
 and letting a more specific memory allocator manage that specific block.
 This means thatSpecial blocks like DMA-buffer and the like, are handled
 by this allocator.
